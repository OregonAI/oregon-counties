"""Build _meta/graph.json — the node/edge artifact the toolkit reads.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS IN THE TEMPLATE. The toolkit only ever READS the graph; it
never writes one. Without it `resolve_citation`, `graph_neighbors` and
`authority_chain` return nothing at all — not an error, just empty results — and
`corpus-validate-frontmatter --changed` loses the universe it resolves
relationship targets against. That failure is completely silent, so a corpus can
look healthy while its citation resolution does nothing. Every corpus needs a
graph builder; this is a working generic one.

It is deliberately simple: nodes from frontmatter, edges from each document's
`relationships` block. That is enough for any corpus whose relationships are
hand-authored or written by its own ingester.

MOST CORPORA WILL OUTGROW IT. The mature reference corpus
(OregonAI/executive-regulatory-frameworks) derives edges MECHANICALLY instead —
parsing authority citations out of each document's own text, resolving statute
renumbering, and keeping implements/implemented_by mirrors symmetric — because
hand-authored edges do not scale to 69,395 documents and drift from the text
they claim to represent. When this corpus reaches that point, replace the
`edges_for` function below rather than bolting derivation on elsewhere.

Cross-corpus targets: an edge whose `to` is a citation string ("ORS 192.311")
rather than a local id is CORRECT and expected — the referenced document lives
in a sibling corpus (see corpus.yml `siblings:`). Those are emitted as-is and
counted separately, so an unresolvable `to` means "look next door", not "broken".

  python3 src/build_graph.py           # write _meta/graph.json
  python3 src/build_graph.py --check   # exit 1 if stale (wire this into CI)

Frontmatter parsing and the content walk come from the toolkit (`corpus_toolkit.repo`), so
this builder sees exactly the documents the validator sees -- one scan rule, not two kept in
step by hand.
